- **Exposing RESTful API Endpoints:**  
  Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations to manage clinic data.
- **Ensuring Reliable Database Connectivity:**  
  Leverage ADO.NET for direct and efficient interaction with the database.
- **Adhering to Best Practices:**  
  Incorporate modern coding practices, error handling, and modular design.

## Key Features

- **API Endpoints:**  
  Secure and standardized endpoints to handle various clinic operations.
- **Data Management:**  
  Seamless integration with your database for robust data handling.
- **Extensible Architecture:**  
  A modular design that allows easy expansion of features as the clinic grows.

## Technologies Used
